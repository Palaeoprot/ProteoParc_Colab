# ProteoParc in Colab

## Overview

**ProteoParc in Colab** is a Jupyter notebook designed to facilitate the analysis of ancient proteins using Google Colab. This notebook provides a streamlined and accessible environment for performing proteomics research, particularly focusing on the analysis of proteins extracted from archaeological samples. The notebook includes scripts and a user-friendly button interface to simplify the workflow.

## Features

- **Cloud-based Analysis**: Utilise the power of Google Colab to run your analyses without the need for local computational resources.
- **Comprehensive Pipeline**: Includes steps for data preprocessing, protein identification, and result visualisation.
- **Interactive**: The notebook format allows for interactive exploration and manipulation of data.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Includes buttons and scripts to make the process straightforward and accessible.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this notebook, you will need:

- A Google account to access Google Colab.
- Basic knowledge of proteomics and Jupyter notebooks.

### Setting up

1. **Create a Directory**

   Create a directory called `proteoparc` in your Colab Notebooks folder. (MyDrive/Colab Notebooks) is generated by Colab in your Google Drive:

   ```
   /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/proteoparc
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**

   - Navigate to your Google Drive.
   - Open the `ProteoParc_in_Colab.ipynb` notebook using Google Colab.

3. **Install Required Libraries**

   The first few cells of the notebook will install the necessary Python libraries. Simply execute these cells to set up the environment.

### Usage

1. **Load Your Data**

   Upload your proteomics data files to the `proteoparc` directory in the Google Colab environment as instructed in the notebook.

2. **Run the Analysis**

   Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to run the analysis. The user-friendly button interface allows you to execute different parts of the workflow easily.

3. **Interpret the Results**

   Use the visualisations and output provided by the notebook to interpret your results.
